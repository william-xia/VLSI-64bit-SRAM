Abstract - \\
This report discusses the design concepts and optimizations of five components of SRAM memory system - registers, decoder, write-circuit, read circuit, and SRAM cells. 
The layout of 64-bit SRAM is also included in this report. 
Finally, we show our comprehensive testing results to demonstrate the correct functionality of combined circuit.\\
